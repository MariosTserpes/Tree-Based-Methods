Exercise 1 
In the lab of the course, a classification tree was applied to the Carseats data set after 
converting Sales into a qualitative response variable. Now we will seek to predict Sales using 
regression trees and related approaches, treating the response as a quantitative variable. 
(a) Split the data set into a training set and a test set 
(b) Fit a regression tree to the training set. Plot the tree and interpret the results. What train 
and what test MSE do you obtain? Is there any indication for overfitting? 
(c) Use cross-validation in order to determine the optimal level of tree complexity. Does 
pruning the tree improve the test MSE? What about train MSE? 
(d) Use the bagging approach in order to analyze this data. What train and what test MSE do 
you obtain? Use the importance() function to determine which variables are most important. 
(e) Use random forests to analyze this data. What train and what test MSE do you obtain? Use 
the importance() function to determine which variables are most important. Describe the 
effect of m, the number of variables considered at each split, on the error rate obtained.


Exercise 2 
Answer the following questions by making use of the OJ data set which is part of the ISLR R 
package (You can find information about OJ data set by typing “?OJ”). 
(a) Create a training set containing a random sample of 800 observations, and a test set 
containing the remaining observations. 
(b) Fit a tree to the training data, with Purchase as the response and the other variables as 
predictors. Use the summary() function to produce summary statistics about the tree, and 
describe the results obtained. What is the training error rate? How many terminal nodes does 
the tree have? 
(c) Type in the name of the tree object in order to get a detailed text output. Pick one of the 
terminal nodes, and interpret the information displayed. 
(d) Create a plot of the tree, and interpret the results. 
(e) Predict the response on the test data, and produce a confusion matrix comparing the test 
labels to the predicted test labels. What is the test error rate? Repeat the same for the train 
data set, as well. 
(f) Apply the cv.tree() function to the training set in order to determine the optimal tree size. 
(g) Produce a plot with tree size on the x-axis and cross-validated classification error rate on 
the y-axis. 
(h) Which tree size corresponds to the lowest cross-validated classification error rate? 
(i) Produce a pruned tree corresponding to the optimal tree size obtained using crossvalidation. If cross-validation does not lead to selection of a pruned tree, then create a pruned 
tree with five terminal nodes. 
(j) Compare the training error rates between the pruned and unpruned trees. Which is higher? 
Explain! 
(k) Compare the test error rates between the pruned and unpruned trees. Which is higher? 
Explain!
